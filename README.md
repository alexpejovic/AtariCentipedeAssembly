# Atari Centipede

This is a re-creation of the Atari classic Centipede written in MIPS assembly
language. This was done as a final project for the course CSC258 at the
University of Toronto. To run this game, you need to install the MARS IDE
for MIPS, connect the keyboard and graphics interpreters in the IDE, then
build and run the assembly file, centipede.s. Use the key 's' to start and
restart the game, keys 'j' and 'k' to move your bug left and right,
respectively.
